My family went to a photo studio taking photos today. We planned to do that on the 100th day of my son, but I always got things at work that made me could not go to my hometown. Finally, we made it in the vacation of national day.

He has 4 teeth now. It is very sad you can only see two of them. I am the lucky man to them all.
