I reimplemented my site with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) today. The theme is [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/) The original site is implemented in html. It is not easy to add new pages or modify contents. The old site is not well maintained.

My iPhone was upgraded to iOS 17 a few day ago. iOS 17 comes with Journal app. I like the idea of Journal and I used it for some days. Actually, it is not a good app. At least, I do not like it. It has very poor functionality.

I decided to pick up my github pages and use it to show my CV, also to write some posts. Maybe I will migrate my posts on others site here. I am not sure if I have time to do that.


Finally, [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is a great software.
