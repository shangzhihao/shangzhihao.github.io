We went to Jianye Huayi Brothers Film Townlet on the New Year's day. It was very cold and my son is too little to go there.

My daughter and niece were expected together on my father's birthday two weeks ago. My nephew had a fever when my borther's family was on the way to my place. They had to go to the hospital. The two little girls were very sad and cried for a while. Finally, they saw each other on my birthday and went to the Film Townlet on the second day.

Night fell. The street was more beatiful, but we had to go home. I did not see my son for the whole day. He must miss his mommy and me.
