My name is Shang Zhihao (尚志浩). I got my PhD under supervision of [Prof. Dr. Katinka Wolter](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/inf/groups/ag-dds/staff/wolter.html) from Free University of Berlin in Dec. 2019. I am working at Zhengzhou University of Light Industry now. My research interests include time series forecastng, deep learning.
