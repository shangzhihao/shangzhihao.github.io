      <description>My family went to a photo studio taking photos today. We planned to do that on the 100th day of my son, but I always got things at work that made me could not go to my hometown. Finally, we made it in the vacation of national day.
He has 4 teeth now.
This is my daughter&amp;rsquo;s favorite. </description>
