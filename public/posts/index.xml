      <description>I reimplemented my site with Hugo today. The original site is implemented in html. It is not easy to add new pages or modify contents. The old site is not well maintained.
My iPhone was upgraded to iOS 17 a few day ago. iOS 17 comes with Journal app. I like the idea of Journal and I used it for some days. Actually, it is not a good app. At least, I do not like it.</description>

      <description>My family went to a photo studio taking photos today. We planned to do that on the 100th day of my son, but I always got things at work that made me could not go to my hometown. Finally, we made it in the vacation of national day.
He has 4 teeth now.
This is my daughter&amp;rsquo;s favorite. </description>
